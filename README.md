## About
**spaceXnecro Project is a assignment for class game programming. This is a game based on the classic pong arcade game, in this game there is 2 playable character on the left side is the red sorcerer and on the right is the purple knight, they are battling in space countering the eye ball to the opponent's side. In this game i have added a few feature like 1 player mode against AI or 2 player mode where 2 people can play together, and the controls for each of the playable character are (Red Sorcerer (W and S) & Purple knight (Up arrow key and Down arrow key)),
i also added after effect to make the game visually better.
